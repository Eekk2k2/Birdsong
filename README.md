## A game engine.
This is a game engine written in C++ and which uses the [OpenGL graphics API](https://www.opengl.org/). As of now it is just a humble little project only I am working on. I want this engine to eventually be the foundation of some infinite space exploration game, so the features of this engine are(- and for the features that will come, will be) geared towards that. You are free to use this engine however you would like **for now**. If you need any help related to that, don't be scared to send me a dm or email.

## Features
TODO

## The documentation
There isnt any as of now, but, as I stated earlier, if you want to use the engine and need help with anything regarding that, dm me. 

## Installation process
Again, as of now there isn't any large support for other people using this engine. You should just be able to clone it and build it from there.
